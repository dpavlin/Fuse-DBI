Fuse::DBI - mount your database as filesystem and use it
========================================================

This module will use Fuse module, part of FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace)
available at http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ to mount your database as file
system.

That will give you possibility to use normal file-system tools (cat, grep,
vi) to manipulate data in database.

It's actually opposite of Oracle's intention to put everything into
database.

Type perldoc Fuse::DBI or perldoc examples/webgui.pl to get more
instructions.

Fuse::DBI - mount your database as filesystem and use it
========================================================

This module will use Fuse module, part of FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace)
available at http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ to mount your database as file
system. Fuse is currently available only for Linux because it consists of
kernel module and user-land library.

That will give you possibility to use normal file-system tools (cat, grep,
vi) to manipulate data in database.

It's actually opposite of Oracle's intention to put everything into
database.

Type perldoc Fuse::DBI or perldoc examples/webgui.pl to get more
instructions.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Fuse
   DBI
   Carp
   POSIX
   File::Find

Fuse module comes from CVS version of Fuse. It's important to have fuse
library and perl bindings in sync. In past, it was tested with older
versions of fuse, but no guarantees are made for this to work.

If you have problem compiling Fuse perl bindings, try to apply patch from
fuse-perl-patch directory. This shouldn't be necessary because current CVS
version of Fuse perl bindings already has this patch applied.
